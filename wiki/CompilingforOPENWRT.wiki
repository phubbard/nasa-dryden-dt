#summary compiling programs to run on OPENWRT

= Introduction =

The 9602 daemon is C based. To cross compile a C program for openwrt is pretty straight forward. Start by reading the following link. It goes through the simple process of creating a basic hellworld program and a makefile to include in the openwrt build directory:

There are two philosophies on running the daemon.
1. On the router itself.
2. On the machine connecting to the router, i.e., your PC or handheld device.

The advantage/disadvantage of both:
On the router:
     1. All the clients only need to send UDP/TCP data to the daemon. 
     2. Daemon should be able to hand multiple connections.
     3. The price, you take processor/memory from the router itself.
On the client:
     1. Processor/memory not an issue
     2. The price, you can't connect multiple devices to one serial device. So, one 
        device will get priority or the others will kick that device off.
     3. Also, everyone must keep a copy of the program.
